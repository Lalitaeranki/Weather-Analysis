# Weather-Analysis
A Webpage  to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. In this project Python script is used to create scatter plot .The scatter plot between temperature and latitude clearly shows us there is a increase in the temperature as we are nearing the equator, but this is not truely supported by the other graphs as we see that its more humid on the southern pole or side from humidity Vs Latilude graph. The Wind speed based on current data is more high in humid and rainy areas in southern side also its more cloudy on Southern side from the analysis we did. This work shows there is an increase in tempreature as we approach equator but other factors like wind speed , cloudyness and humidity are based on tropical approach
